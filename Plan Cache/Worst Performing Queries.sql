 Title:			Worst Performing Queries
 Created by:	Mark S. Rasmussen <mark@improve.dk>
 License:		CC BY 3.0
 
 Usage:
 Returns a list of the most time consuming queries, server wide. Depending on what
 kind of queries you're looking for, you can uncomment the relevant predicates.
 
 options can be used :  Most CPU consuming
	    GROUP BY s.plan_handle ORDER BY SUM(s.total_worker_time) DESC
		
	    Most read+write IO consuming
	    GROUP BY s.plan_handle ORDER BY SUM(s.total_logical_reads + s.total_logical_writes) DESC
		
	    Most write IO consuming
	    GROUP BY s.plan_handle ORDER BY SUM(s.total_logical_writes) DESC
		
	    Most CLR consuming
	    WHERE s.total_clr_time > 0 GROUP BY s.plan_handle ORDER BY SUM(s.total_clr_time) DESC
